***REF(Requests for Evidence)***<br/>
Requests for evidence (RFE) are sent to students when there is a relatively minor correction or clarification (additional information)that needs to be made. These can include:<br/>
1. Passports that have less than 6 months of validity or expired passports<br/>
2. You filled out a particular section of the I765 incorrectly or not at all (e.g., I-94 number was incorrect or you forgot to add your most recent date of entry into the U.S.)<br/>
3. Information on I-94/I-20 is inconsistent or incorrect (e.g., incorrect name order, wrong visa class, etc.)<br/>
4. Your photos are older than 30 days or are of poor quality<br/>
5. You need to prove that you fulfilled your eligibility requirements for OPT (i.e., you will be asked to submit an academic transcript to USCIS)<br/>
6. Your photo ID could not be confirmed<br/>
***Note: It’s at USCIS’s discretion to issue the student an RFE. The adjudicator (processor of your application) may either issue an RFE or deny your application if there are errors or missing information***<br/>

***Rejection***<br/>
A rejection occurs when the USCIS Lockbox (mailing) Facility sends back your entire OPT application packet without sending it to a Service Center for processing. Potential reasons why:<br/>
1. Your check or other payment method failed<br/>
2. You did not sign your form I-765<br/>
3. Your OPT application packet is missing several required documents<br/>
4. You did not select a reason for applying (the very first question on the I-765)<br/>
5. Outdated edition of I-765 (please go directly to the USCIS website to download the most recent version of the I-765 each time you apply.)<br/>
***Please note that USCIS DOES NOT process your payment for a rejection.***


***Denial***<br/>
A denial occurs when your OPT application packet is sent to a Service Center for adjudication (processing) and the adjudicator discovers that you’re unequivocally ineligible for OPT. Potential reasons why:<br/>
1. You submitted your application packet to USCIS more than 30 days AFTER the date ISSS issued your I-20.<br/>
2. You’ve already been approved for OPT at the same degree level (only one OPT authorization per degree level).<br/>
3. You clearly have not met your eligibility requirements (i.e., one academic year of full-time studies)<br/>
4. You applied for OPT after the 60-day grace period expired<br/>
***Note: USCIS will process your payment for a denial***<br/>

Source：https://sjsu.edu/isss/docs/Rejections_Denials_RFEs.pdf<br/>
***Note: ALWAYS TALK TO YOUR SCHOOL DSO BEFORE RESPONDING TO AN RFE, REJECTION, OR DENIAL!!!***<br/>
***Responding to an RFE:***<br/>
1. Do EXACTLY what the RFE instructs (e.g., it will tell you specifically what you need to redo or submit, do not submit more documents than necessary!!)<br/>
2. Make sure to include the entire cover letter of the RFE on top of your new document submission.<br/>
3. Submit directly to the address on the RFE<br/>
4. As with rejections and denials, your OPT application will be delayed as a result and your total OPT authorization period may be reduced<br/>
***Note:<br/>PLEASE RESPOND WITHIN THE INDICATED TIMEFRAME ON THE RFE, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 30 TO 90 DAYS.<br/>
RESPOND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO AVOID DELAYING YOUR OPT APPLICATION FURTHER***

***Responding to a Rejection:***<br/>
1. Must refile ENTIRE application with cover letter of rejection notice on top<br/>
2. Resubmit payment (original check would have been sent back to you so you won’t have to pay twice)<br/>
3. You will be unable to refile an application if your grace period has expired already<br/>
4. Request another I-20 for OPT from ISSS<br/>
5. Your 12 months of OPT will most likely be reduced because of this delay<br/>

***Responding to a Denial:****<br/>
1. Once again, you must refile the entire application AND pay another fee of $410.00 so long as your grace period has
not expired.<br/>
2. Request another I-20 for OPT from ISSS<br/>
3. As with a rejection, your 12 months of OPT will most likely be reduced because of the delay<br/>



## 10. Will it affect my future visa if I participate in the class action?
### - Answer from lawyer: We get this question all of the time, it is a common concern.  We have never seen USCIS take adverse action because somebody filed suit, or was associated with a lawsuit  More often, as Caroline explained on the call, they will pull your application to give you the relief sought in order to defeat the class action. While we can’t promise that there will never be any adverse action, we can tell you that we have never seen this in the past.  I don’t think it is likely if for no other reason (and there are other reasons), USCIS has no central repository of information to put a “black mark” on your file.
