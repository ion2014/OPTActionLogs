# Frequently Asked Questions

## 1. What can I do next if I delivered my application XXX weeks ago, but still haven't got a receipt?
### - Answer:
Check whether the delivery is normal and confirm that the materials have been delivered.
Check if the check/money order has been cashed.:

1. If it is a cashier check, you can call the bank or go to the bank with the cashier check number.<br/>
2. If it is a Money order from USPS or MoneyGram, you can find it on their website. <br/>

Ask Emma to check the receipt number by asking Emma to transfer to the manual service. After entering the chat room, the representative lived.<br/>

## 2. Where can I look up the most recent updates on OPT application processing?
### - Answer:
OPT Timeline： https://opttimeline.com/<br/>
OPT Receipt Monitor： https://www.optreceiptmonitor.com/<br/>

## 3. How many cases are approved today?
### - Answer:
OPT Timeline： https://opttimeline.com/<br/>
OPT Receipt Monitor： https://www.optreceiptmonitor.com/<br/>

## 4. What if my Check/MoneyOrder is over 90 days?
### - Answer:
At present, most of the banks we have consulted have responded: Don’t worry, as long as the money in the account is not withdrawn and the replacement of MoneyOrder is not applied, USCIS can cash within one year.<br/>
But we suggest that you still check with your bank to make sure you are foolproof.<br/>

## 5. How to talk to a real person through EMMA / USCIS contact number?
### - Answer:
EMMA: Technical issue -> technical problem <br/>
EMMA: request infopass <br/>
Phone: I want to check my case status -> I have not received my receipt -> I've sent it to service center (say lockbox Emma would ask for your email instead) -> It's been more than 30 days -> yes it was delivered <br/>


## 6. If I have passed the Grace Period and are still waiting for OPT approval, can I still stay in the United States legally?？
### - Answer：
Yes, as long as you send out OPT before the Grace period, you can stay in the United States legally while your OPT is pending with USCIS (including the case of no receipt).

## 7. While waiting for OPT application is pending at USCIS (before receiving the EAD card), can I leave the US and go to other countries? And just let my friend mail the EAD card to me after it was delivered, so that I will enter the United States with the EAD card?
### - Answer：
No, don't do that. The advice of all lawyers and school dso is to never do this.


## 8. I have already sent an OPT application to AZ/TX, can I send another copy to Chicago lockbox?
### - Answer:
We understand that the replies from the DSO of the schools do not recommend this. If there is no problem with the materials, it is not recommended to send a second copy! The possible risks are:<br/>

1. If you get both receipts and finally withdraw one of them, there is a risk that both copies will be withdrawn (specific example: http://forum.desiopt.com/showthread.php/6245-Duplicate-OPT-Stem- application).<br/>
2. If you get both receipts and enter the system for processing, if one of them is denied during the grace period or the stem 180 days extension, the SEVIS system is directly terminated, and the other one may not be approved. (If I want to re-send the I-20, it will be sent 1 to 2 days before the expiration date. I see that many people’s receipt time will have an error of 1 to 2 days before and after, so I am worried that the second copy will violate I-20 60 days. The rule is denied to cause the second situation to occur).<br/>
3. If two receipts are obtained and both enter the system for processing, some school’s DSO says "Submitting two applications is against immigration regulations. If two applications are in the system, it could result in an automatic rejection/denial for both".<br/>

**No matter what the situation, don't re-file your opt without authorization. In any situation, contact the school's DSO directly, they will help you contact uscis!**


## 9. I have already sent an OPT application to AZ/TX, can I send another copy to Chicago lockbox?
### - Answer:
**First of all, don't re-file opt without authorization, first contact the school's DSO directly and ask them if it is feasible!**<br/>
Combining the above three possible risks, we believe that if you meet the following conditions, sending the second copy **may be relatively less risky**:<br/>

1. First of all, if your i-20 is not more than 30/60 days, the risk of reopening the i-20 without receiving the rejection is very high, because the first application will not be rej (if you have no use Wrong form or let him be rej by canceling check etc.), but it will be denied after entering the system. If your second copy entered the system at that time, it is likely that your first copy will be during the second process. If it is denied, the sevis record will have a risk of being terminated directly.<br/>
2. The first one can be guaranteed to be rejected by the lockbox, so that there is only one application in the final system (because the check amount is incorrect, or the old I-765 form is used. Friends who use personal check can find a way to block the transaction of the first application , But canceling the check is also risky. If you use cashier check or money order, please think twice, these two payments should not be canceled, and there is a high probability that two applications will enter the system in the end).<br/>
3. Both applications must be foolproof. If you are not sure whether the second one will be sent within 60 days, there is a risk that the second one will be denied. As above, the SEVIS system is directly terminated, and the other one may not be possible. Get approval.<br/>


## 10. What are REF，Rejection, and Denial?
### - Answer：<br/>
Source：https://sjsu.edu/isss/docs/Rejections_Denials_RFEs.pdf<br/>
***REF(Requests for Evidence)***<br/>
Requests for evidence (RFE) are sent to students when there is a relatively minor correction or clarification (additional information)that needs to be made. These can include:<br/>
1. Passports that have less than 6 months of validity or expired passports<br/>
2. You filled out a particular section of the I765 incorrectly or not at all (e.g., I-94 number was incorrect or you forgot to add your most recent date of entry into the U.S.)<br/>
3. Information on I-94/I-20 is inconsistent or incorrect (e.g., incorrect name order, wrong visa class, etc.)<br/>
4. Your photos are older than 30 days or are of poor quality<br/>
5. You need to prove that you fulfilled your eligibility requirements for OPT (i.e., you will be asked to submit an academic transcript to USCIS)<br/>
6. Your photo ID could not be confirmed<br/>
***Note: It’s at USCIS’s discretion to issue the student an RFE. The adjudicator (processor of your application) may either issue an RFE or deny your application if there are errors or missing information***<br/>

***Rejection***<br/>
A rejection occurs when the USCIS Lockbox (mailing) Facility sends back your entire OPT application packet without sending it to a Service Center for processing. Potential reasons why:<br/>
1. Your check or other payment method failed<br/>
2. You did not sign your form I-765<br/>
3. Your OPT application packet is missing several required documents<br/>
4. You did not select a reason for applying (the very first question on the I-765)<br/>
5. Outdated edition of I-765 (please go directly to the USCIS website to download the most recent version of the I-765 each time you apply.)<br/>
***Please note that USCIS DOES NOT process your payment for a rejection.***


***Denial***<br/>
A denial occurs when your OPT application packet is sent to a Service Center for adjudication (processing) and the adjudicator discovers that you’re unequivocally ineligible for OPT. Potential reasons why:<br/>
1. You submitted your application packet to USCIS more than 30 days AFTER the date ISSS issued your I-20.<br/>
2. You’ve already been approved for OPT at the same degree level (only one OPT authorization per degree level).<br/>
3. You clearly have not met your eligibility requirements (i.e., one academic year of full-time studies)<br/>
4. You applied for OPT after the 60-day grace period expired<br/>
***Note: USCIS will process your payment for a denial***<br/>


## 11. What if my OPT application got REF，Rejection,Denial？
### - Answer：<br/>
Source：https://sjsu.edu/isss/docs/Rejections_Denials_RFEs.pdf<br/>
***Note: ALWAYS TALK TO YOUR SCHOOL DSO BEFORE RESPONDING TO AN RFE, REJECTION, OR DENIAL!!!***<br/>
***Responding to an RFE:***<br/>
1. Do EXACTLY what the RFE instructs (e.g., it will tell you specifically what you need to redo or submit, do not submit more documents than necessary!!)<br/>
2. Make sure to include the entire cover letter of the RFE on top of your new document submission.<br/>
3. Submit directly to the address on the RFE<br/>
4. As with rejections and denials, your OPT application will be delayed as a result and your total OPT authorization period may be reduced<br/>
***Note:<br/>PLEASE RESPOND WITHIN THE INDICATED TIMEFRAME ON THE RFE, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 30 TO 90 DAYS.<br/>
RESPOND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO AVOID DELAYING YOUR OPT APPLICATION FURTHER***

***Responding to a Rejection:***<br/>
1. Must refile ENTIRE application with cover letter of rejection notice on top<br/>
2. Resubmit payment (original check would have been sent back to you so you won’t have to pay twice)<br/>
3. You will be unable to refile an application if your grace period has expired already<br/>
4. Request another I-20 for OPT from ISSS<br/>
5. Your 12 months of OPT will most likely be reduced because of this delay<br/>

***Responding to a Denial:****<br/>
1. Once again, you must refile the entire application AND pay another fee of $410.00 so long as your grace period has
not expired.<br/>
2. Request another I-20 for OPT from ISSS<br/>
3. As with a rejection, your 12 months of OPT will most likely be reduced because of the delay<br/>



## 12. Will it affect my future visa if I participate in the class action?
### - Answer from lawyer: <br/>
We get this question all of the time, it is a common concern.  We have never seen USCIS take adverse action because somebody filed suit, or was associated with a lawsuit  More often, as Caroline explained on the call, they will pull your application to give you the relief sought in order to defeat the class action. While we can’t promise that there will never be any adverse action, we can tell you that we have never seen this in the past.  I don’t think it is likely if for no other reason (and there are other reasons), USCIS has no central repository of information to put a “black mark” on your file.
