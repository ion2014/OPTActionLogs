# Litigation Process
- 1/23/2021 The Volunteer Committee organized a meeting that included answers to basic questions related to litigation and various lawyers. The slides and meeting video are as follows:<br/>

  - [Zoom Video Recording: What Volunteers have done about the Lawsuit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11_Yd-j1XkMJXeN_e7zTBIpwOArTQZwk9/view?usp=sharing)<br/>
- At present, we have contacted a total of 9 lawyers. The summary of each lawyer's information and contact information is as follows. <br/>
- The results of the last poll showed that most peopleâ€™s first choice was Robert Cohen, and the second choice was Brad Banias. 
  - For lawyer Robert, we will organize people together. 
  - For lawyer Brad, we will update all his progress and how to sign up below. Those who want to participate Students can register directly. <br/>
- **According to Brad Banias, you can only participate in one class action, so for people who chooses Robert's class action, don't participate in Brad's, and vice versa** <br/>
- Many students worry about what to do if they are rej/deny after the Grace period. This question is one of the core demands of our lawsuit. We have emphasized it with every lawyer, and they will address this issue in their argue points. So donâ€™t worry.<br/>

***Here are our main request proposals***:<br/>
1. We want to see USCIS adjudicate our case and approve our EAD card within 90 days of the application delivery.<br/>
2. We want USCIS to promise that no applications shall be rejected or denied if the applicant has not received a receipt notice in 60 days. We demand USCIS allow the applicant to refile their applications or provide supplementary materials if requested.<br/>

***Disclaimers***: 
1. Joining the lawsuit is completely voluntary. The choice of lawyer is completely voluntary. Please note that no lawyer or Volunteer Committee forces anyone to join any litigation or promise any outcome.
2. As of now, it is strongly recommended NOT to join two lawsuits simultaneously at this point in time as this might complicate the case for the law firms and jeopardize the lawsuit. 
3. As a reserved plaintiff, you could withdraw anytime from the class action.

### Lawsuit Process (in reverse order)
***CASE HAS BEEN FILED TO THE COURT!!!!!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ (2/16/2021)*** <br/>

***Students who want to participate in Robert Class Action, complete this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPiJ1dh5pDOxtDM6obqQIi1JDP2pCH57bJyQttGXcj8yo4YA/viewform) as soon as possible, you can still be added as reserved plaintiff***<br/>

***First batch of named plaintiffs have completed the payment today (02/09/2021). The lawyer selected named plaintiffs. If you were not contacted by the lawyer directly, you are not named plaintiffs; instead, you and hundreds of students will be listed as reserved plaintiffs once you filled out the [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPiJ1dh5pDOxtDM6obqQIi1JDP2pCH57bJyQttGXcj8yo4YA/viewform). Resevered plaintiffs will be added as named plaintiffs in batches. As for the reserved plaintiffs, no need for payment right now.***<br/>

***Quote from Robert's email regarding the reserved plaintiffs:***<br/>
The benefit of a class action is that the named plaintiffs are representatives of the class. The class will included all foreign citizens in student status who have submitted an application for OPT, and whose receipt has not been issued or whose application has not been timely adjudicated.  It is not necessary for every member of the class to be named, they are part of this class by definition, so when the Court orders a remedy, or we are able to negotiate a remedy, all members of the class will be included, not just those named.  The named plaintiffs represent a range of issues, and our goal was include the representatives as just that, representative of the entire class.  The named plaintiffs, as representatives, have taken on the additional responsibility of assisting us with information and communication, and the assistance with costs.  If we find that the costs are higher, and we need more money we may ask for others to make a similar contribution.

Whether a student can stay in the US if he/she gets a rejection notice after their grace period, please see [Lawsuit FAQ](https://ion2014.github.io/OPTActionLogs/lawsuit_faq_en)<br/>
Emailed a draft complaint for volunteer committee to review later today or tomorrow.  (The complaint is the legal document that begins a lawsuit; it identifies all the plaintiffs and defendants and explains the facts and legal claims.) <br/>
 
Robert hopes to send out the payment link later today (02/09/2021).<br/>

Robert also said: <br/>
We have seen announcements with an excuse as to why the receipts have been delayed, and while we donâ€™t think the excuses provided have been persuasive, it is clear that USCIS recognizes they have a problem.Â  Our concern is not only the delay in the receipts, but with the substantive problems that the delay has caused, many of which are identified in the discussion earlier in this string.Â  We hope and anticipate that this lawsuit will give us an opportunity to fashion remedies for students who have been impacted by the delay, not only the delay getting the receipt, but consequences of that the delay has caused, such as shortened periods of OPT and rejections for technical reasons coupled with the expiration of deadlines.Â <br/>

***1/30/2021*** Phone calls with Robert, summarized as follows:<br/>
The case has not been filed yet, but Robert and his team is working on it and will let us know once their done and will send out payment link by then.

***1/29/2021*** Phone calls with Robert, summarized as follows:<br/>
  1. this is a special case with an usual fee arrangement so that is why it is taking some time because there are several internal level of approval to go through<br/>
  2. Currently Rob's team is working on the complaints, which will be ready within the next day or 2.<br/>
  3. Case will be filed in Ohio<br/>
  4. The case will be filed within the next couple of days. <br/>

- **The payment link have not yet been received. (not sure whether it is payment in batches or as a whole. will report to you guys when Robert responds)**< br/>

***1/28/2021*** Robert promised to take our case<br/>
***1/28/2021*** The first litigant (the first classmate to contact Robert) signs fee agreement<br/>
***1/28/2021*** Find a student who is willing to be a representative of Ohio (because the case needs to file to the federal court in Ohio), and we learned that 15 named plaintiffs are needed, and the remaining students will be litigated as reserved plaintiffs (about named plaintiff and For reserved plaintiffs, see [Lawsuit FAQ](https://ion2014.github.io/OPTActionLogs/lawsuit_faq_en)<br/>
***1/19/2021*** first zoom meeting<br/>


### Lawsuit Plan
- Class action lawsuit on behalf of students who have filed applications for Optional Practical Training and STEM extensions of OPT with USCIS, and have not received receipts or the benefits of a timely processed application. <br/>
- ***Definition for our class: those who have no receipt and those who have not enjoyed the benefits of a timely processed OPT/EAD. Therefore, no matter TX or AZ, as long as it is delayed after the end of October, it can be counted Come in. Now it's the overall delay. It should have been approve in three months. Now neither AZ nor TX can be approve in three months, so our big wave is counted. (Because we first sent OPT 90 days before graduation, in theory, USCIS should issue us the card within 90 days after we send it.) I also asked Robert about AZ; Robert said that AZ must be included, and Robert said that TX and AZ are inseparable in EAD matters, because the same department handles the approval.***<br/>
- ***The request of Robert's case is not receipt, which has nothing to do with receipt, but EAD, which is to get an EAD card.***<br/>
- Last year, in Robert's H4 case, there were about 300 plaintiffs, but even if someone wasn't plaintiff, he/she still enjoyed the final lawsuit benefits, that is, you can go to work with the approval receipt, you don't need to get the ead card. <br/>
- File location: OH
- $50/person (material collection/filing fee, not legal fee)
- Plans: The case will be filed within the next couple of days (hoping would be this Thursday)
- If USCIS lost/settle, lawyer recieve compensation for the legal services from USCIS. In other words, its USCIS to pay the lawyer, not us.
- Best outcome: EAD card
