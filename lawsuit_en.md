# Litigation Process
- 1/23/2021 The Volunteer Committee organized a meeting that included answers to basic questions related to litigation and various lawyers. The slides and meeting video are as follows:<br/>

  - [Zoom Video Recording: What Volunteers have done about the Lawsuit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11_Yd-j1XkMJXeN_e7zTBIpwOArTQZwk9/view?usp=sharing)<br/>
- At present, we have contacted a total of 9 lawyers. The summary of each lawyer's information and contact information is as follows. <br/>
- The results of the last poll showed that most people’s first choice was Robert Cohen, and the second choice was Brad Banias. 
  - For lawyer Robert, we will organize people together. 
  - For lawyer Brad, we will update all his progress and how to sign up below. Those who want to participate Students can register directly. <br/>
- **According to Brad Banias, you can only participate in one class action, so for people who chooses Robert's class action, don't participate in Brad's, and vice versa** <br/>
- Many students worry about what to do if they are rej/deny after the Grace period. This question is one of the core demands of our lawsuit. We have emphasized it with every lawyer, and they will address this issue in their argue points. So don’t worry.<br/>

***Here are our main Appeals (Quote from the filed complaint)***:<br/>
1. Plaintiffs seek, on behalf of themselves and unnamed class members, a mandatory temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief that requires USCIS to open, process and adjudicate applications submitted by Plaintiffs and unnamed class members on an immediate basis, and to provide weekly status reports to the Court and counsel.<br/>
2. Plaintiffs further seek, on behalf of themselves and unnamed class members, a declaration that USCIS has violated its legal obligations to open, process and adjudicate the applications submitted by Plaintiffs and unnamed class members.<br/>
3. Plaintiffs further seek, on behalf of themselves and unnamed class members, equitable relief that relieves them of the irreparable harm that they have suffered and are threatened with suffering, including the following relief:<br/>
(a) an order that enjoins ICE from removing Plaintiffs and unnamed class members who have lost their F-1 status while their applications remain pending with USCIS;<br/>
(b) an order that students whose grace period expired while they were waiting for USCIS to adjudicate their applications will remain in F-1 status until at least
fourteen (14) days after their application has been adjudicated;<br/>
(c) an order that requires USCIS not to reject applications submitted by Plaintiffs and unnamed class members for technical errors where such applications cannot be corrected and resubmitted within the applicable deadlines, and instead to accept such applications, issue a receipt, and issue a Request for Evidence to correct any alleged deficiencies;<br/>
(d) in addition or in the alternative, an order that requires USCIS to accept and consider applications that are corrected and resubmitted by Plaintiffs and unnamed class members within sixty (60) days after the date that they are rejected, notwithstanding the expiration of the applicable deadlines; and<br/>
(e) for OPT applications, an order that permits Plaintiffs and unnamed class members to complete their full 12 months of optional practical training running from the date that their application is approved, even if USCIS’s undue delay means that they must complete it later than 14 months after the date they completed their studies.<br/>
4. Plaintiff further seeks an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs under the Equal Access to Justice Act.<br/>

***Disclaimers***: 
1. Joining the lawsuit is completely voluntary. The choice of lawyer is completely voluntary. Please note that no lawyer or Volunteer Committee forces anyone to join any litigation or promise any outcome.
2. As of now, it is strongly recommended NOT to join two lawsuits simultaneously at this point in time as this might complicate the case for the law firms and jeopardize the lawsuit. 
3. As a reserved plaintiff, you could withdraw anytime from the class action.

<br/>
<br/>

***03/04/2021*** Update from phone call with Rob:
1. Interim WA: No response from USCIS today (maybe tomorrow, no guarantee)
2. Twitter is very useful, please keep on tweeting
3. USCIS is not putting OPT as first priority compared to (DACA, etc) due to lack of public attention / exposure
4. Slow approving speed, USCIS is not giving any other reason except covid


***2/26/2021*** 🎉🎉🎉 Lawsuit reached first milestone, USCIS announced new policy (the lawsuit is still in progress. Next week, the lawyers will discuss with the government to address the issue of extremely long OPT processing time): 

Becuase of the delays at certain lockboxes, USCIS are extending the following flexibilities to applicants who filed application  after Oct. 1, 2020, through May 1, 2021:
1. To allow F-1 students to complete the full period of requested OPT (up to 12 months), USCIS will allow the 14-month period to commence from the date of approval of the Form I-765 for applications for post-completion OPT. And F1 students may request correction if the OPT time is less than 12 months.
2. USCIS will accept a refiled Form I-765 for OPT and STEM OPT, no need an new I-20 from school.
3. For missing or deficient signature, USCIS will issue a Request for Evidence rather than deny the application.

For more details, please see [USCIS Extends Flexibilities to Certain Applicants Filing Form I-765 for OPT](https://www.uscis.gov/news/alerts/uscis-extends-flexibilities-to-certain-applicants-filing-form-i-765-for-opt)<br/>

***2/24/2021*** The "Status of Settlement Discussions" is posted by Robert on the website [OPT CLASS ACTION](http://www.optclassaction.com/)

***2/23/2021*** Robert emailed Lawsuit Update：<br/>
1. Robert's team met with the Government lawyers twice last week to discuss the issues raised by our complaint and they expect to continue the discussions this week.<br/>
2. Robert created the website [OPT CLASS ACTION](http://www.optclassaction.com/) to provide updates and information for the named plaintiffs group, other students who are members of the proposed class, and the public.<br/>

***2/18/2021*** Robert emailed Lawsuit Update：<br/>
Today we received a call from the Assistant US Attorneys representing the Government agencies with an offer to enter into settlement discussions. This first call was very productive and while we didn’t resolve anything in particular, we did agree on a framework for both our discussions and the nature of a final settlement agreement. If we can come to agreement, we will avoid the need for lengthy litigation and will be able to develop an agreement that provides the relief we are seeking. I want to emphasize that it not a “done deal,” we still have a lot of work over the next several days to address all of the issues raised by the complaint, but we are hopeful that this was a good sign and wanted to pass that along. We are also hopeful that by coming to an agreement with a settlement, it will resolve all of the issues quickly. While I would like to provide a firm timeline, at this point, we can’t do that other than to say we are going to be putting this on a fast track to the extent possible. The government also appears to be interested in resolving this quickly. <br/>

Whether a student can stay in the US if he/she gets a rejection notice after their grace period, please see [Lawsuit FAQ](https://ion2014.github.io/OPTActionLogs/lawsuit_faq_en)<br/>
Emailed a draft complaint for volunteer committee to review later today or tomorrow.  (The complaint is the legal document that begins a lawsuit; it identifies all the plaintiffs and defendants and explains the facts and legal claims.) <br/>
 
Robert hopes to send out the payment link later today (02/09/2021).<br/>

Robert also said: <br/>
We have seen announcements with an excuse as to why the receipts have been delayed, and while we don’t think the excuses provided have been persuasive, it is clear that USCIS recognizes they have a problem.  Our concern is not only the delay in the receipts, but with the substantive problems that the delay has caused, many of which are identified in the discussion earlier in this string.  We hope and anticipate that this lawsuit will give us an opportunity to fashion remedies for students who have been impacted by the delay, not only the delay getting the receipt, but consequences of that the delay has caused, such as shortened periods of OPT and rejections for technical reasons coupled with the expiration of deadlines. <br/>

***1/30/2021*** Phone calls with Robert, summarized as follows:<br/>
The case has not been filed yet, but Robert and his team is working on it and will let us know once their done and will send out payment link by then.

***1/29/2021*** Phone calls with Robert, summarized as follows:<br/>

### Lawsuit Plan
- Class action lawsuit on behalf of students who have filed applications for Optional Practical Training and STEM extensions of OPT with USCIS, and have not received receipts or the benefits of a timely processed application. <br/>
- ***Definition for our class: those who have no receipt and those who have not enjoyed the benefits of a timely processed OPT/EAD. Therefore, no matter TX or AZ, as long as it is delayed after the end of October, it can be counted Come in. Now it's the overall delay. It should have been approve in three months. Now neither AZ nor TX can be approve in three months, so our big wave is counted. (Because we first sent OPT 90 days before graduation, in theory, USCIS should issue us the card within 90 days after we send it.) I also asked Robert about AZ; Robert said that AZ must be included, and Robert said that TX and AZ are inseparable in EAD matters, because the same department handles the approval.***<br/>
- ***The request of Robert's case is not receipt, which has nothing to do with receipt, but EAD, which is to get an EAD card.***<br/>
- Last year, in Robert's H4 case, there were about 300 plaintiffs, but even if someone wasn't plaintiff, he/she still enjoyed the final lawsuit benefits, that is, you can go to work with the approval receipt, you don't need to get the ead card. <br/>
- File location: OH
- $50/person (material collection/filing fee, not legal fee)
- Plans: The case will be filed within the next couple of days (hoping would be this Thursday)
- If USCIS lost/settle, lawyer recieve compensation for the legal services from USCIS. In other words, its USCIS to pay the lawyer, not us.
- Best outcome: EAD card
