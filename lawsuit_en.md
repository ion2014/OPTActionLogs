# Litigation Process
- At present, we have contacted a total of 9 lawyers. The summary of each lawyer's information and contact information is as follows. <br/>
- The results of the last poll showed that most people’s first choice was Robert Cohen, and the second choice was Brad Banias. 
  - For lawyer Robert, we will organize people together. 
  - For lawyer Brad, we will update all his progress and how to sign up below. Those who want to participate Students can register directly. <br/>
- **According to Brad Banias, you can only participate in one class action, so for people who chooses Robert's class action, don't participate in Brad's, and vice versa** <br/>
- Many students worry about what to do if they are rej/deny after the Grace period. This question is one of the core demands of our lawsuit. We have emphasized it with every lawyer, and they will address this issue in their argue points. So don’t worry.<br/>

***Here are our main request proposals***:<br/>
1. We want to see USCIS adjudicate our case and approve our EAD card within 90 days of the application delivery.<br/>
2. We want USCIS to promise that no applications shall be rejected or denied if the applicant has not received a receipt notice in 60 days. We demand USCIS allow the applicant to refile their applications or provide supplementary materials if requested.<br/>

***Disclaimers***: 
1. Joining the lawsuit is completely voluntary. The choice of lawyer is completely voluntary. Please note that no lawyer or Volunteer Committee forces anyone to join any litigation or promise any outcome.
2. As of now, it is strongly recommended NOT to join two lawsuits simultaneously at this point in time as this might complicate the case for the law firms and jeopardize the lawsuit. 
3. As a reserved plaintiff, you could withdraw anytime from the class action.

***1/29/2021*** Phone calls with Robert, summarized as follows:<br/>
  1. this is a special case with an usual fee arrangement so that is why it is taking some time because there are several internal level of approval to go through<br/>

***1/28/2021*** The first litigant (the first classmate to contact Robert) signs fee agreement<br/>

***1/19/2021*** first zoom meeting<br/>


### Lawsuit Plan
- Class action lawsuit on behalf of students who have filed applications for Optional Practical Training and STEM extensions of OPT with USCIS, and have not received receipts or the benefits of a timely processed application. <br/>
- ***Definition for our class: those who have no receipt and those who have not enjoyed the benefits of a timely processed OPT/EAD. Therefore, no matter TX or AZ, as long as it is delayed after the end of October, it can be counted Come in. Now it's the overall delay. It should have been approve in three months. Now neither AZ nor TX can be approve in three months, so our big wave is counted. (Because we first sent OPT 90 days before graduation, in theory, USCIS should issue us the card within 90 days after we send it.) I also asked Robert about AZ; Robert said that AZ must be included, and Robert said that TX and AZ are inseparable in EAD matters, because the same department handles the approval.***<br/>
- ***The request of Robert's case is not receipt, which has nothing to do with receipt, but EAD, which is to get an EAD card.***<br/>
- Last year, in Robert's H4 case, there were about 300 plaintiffs, but even if someone wasn't plaintiff, he/she still enjoyed the final lawsuit benefits, that is, you can go to work with the approval receipt, you don't need to get the ead card. <br/>
- File location: OH
- $50/person (material collection/filing fee, not legal fee)
- Plans: The case will be filed within the next couple of days (hoping would be this Thursday)
- If USCIS lost/settle, lawyer recieve compensation for the legal services from USCIS. In other words, its USCIS to pay the lawyer, not us.
- Best outcome: EAD card
