# 诉讼进程
- 目前我们联系了共9位律师，每位律师的资料总结及联系方式汇总如下。<br/>
- 上次投票结果显示大部分人的first choice为Robert Cohen，second choice为Brad Banias，所以对于这两位律师，我们将统一组织，你可以选择参与任何一位的或者两者都参加，也可以都不参加选择其他律师。<br/>
***Disclaimer：加入诉讼完全自愿的。对于律师的选择完全自愿。请注意，没有律师或Volunteer Committee强迫任何人加入任何诉讼或承诺任何结果。***<br/>

### lawsuit计划
- class action lawsuit on behalf of students who have filed applications for Optional Practical Training and STEM extensions of OPT with USCIS, and have not received receipts or the
 benefits of a timely processed application.
- File location: AZ
- $50/person (material collection/filing fee, not legal fee)
- Plans: File the case immediately once we have enougth named plaintiffs, keep adding everyone as reserved plaintiffs until USCIS resolves the whole class's problem/request.
- If USCIS lost/settle, lawyer recieve compensation for the legal services from USCIS. In other words, its USCIS to pay the lawyer, not us.
- Best outcome: EAD card
